{{% notice note %}} Prettifier is an application under ongoing development. It
might ask you for new permissions once in a while. Please accept them, otherwise
Prettifier might cease to function properly. If you have questions or concerns
about permissions, see what Prettifier does with them in the
[source code](https://github.com/kevgo/prettifier/tree/master/bot) or
